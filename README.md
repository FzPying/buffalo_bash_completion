# Buffalo Bash Completion
Bash completion for the [Buffalo](https://gobuffalo.io) web framework

## Usage
- Download the completion file somewhere
- Load it in your shell with `source buffalo_completion.sh`
- Add this line to your `.bashrc` file so that it will be automatically loaded in future shells run

## Features
Currently bash completion works for all first and second level commands, e.g.:
```
buffalo <TAB>
buffalo generate <TAB>
```
Support for command parameters is still missing.
